No one has made this risk algorithm widely available to the public. \n\nFindings\n========================================================\nThe authors found:\n\n- A simple prediction rule\n- Risk ranges from 3% to 32%\n- The impact of outpatient-treated RSV LRTI includes \n    - increased number of physician visits and drug prescriptions\n    - Parents’ missed work days.\n\nRisk factors\n========================================================\nWe developed a list of checkboxes assessing the following risk factors:\n\n- Birthweight > 8.18 lbs (4.5 kg)\n- Birthday between April 1 and September 30\n- Contact with other children \n    - siblings <18 years of age in the home, or\n    - spending any time during the year in day care\n\nSlide With Server Code\n========================================================\n\n```{r}\n# This is the server logic for a Shiny web application.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nweightrisk.RSV <- function(weight) as.numeric(weight)\nmonthrisk.RSV <- function(month) as.numeric(month)\nsibrisk.RSV <- function(sibs) as.numeric(sibs) * 2\neducationrisk.RSV <- function(education) as.numeric(education)\n```\n\nSlide With Server Code (cont.)\n========================================================\n\n```{r}\nshinyServer(\n  function(input, output) {\n  \n  output$month <- renderPrint({ input$month })\n  output$weight <- renderPrint({ input$weight })\n  output$sibs <- renderPrint({ input$sibs })\n  output$education <- renderPrint({ input$education })\n  output$weightrisk.RSV <- renderPrint({ weightrisk.RSV(input$weight) })\n  output$monthrisk.RSV <- renderPrint({ monthrisk.RSV(input$month) })\n  output$sibrisk.RSV <- renderPrint({ sibrisk.RSV(input$sibs) })\n  output$educationrisk.RSV <- renderPrint({ educationrisk.RSV(input$education )})\n})\n```\n\nSlide With Input and Output Code\n========================================================\n\n```{r}\n\n# This is the user-interface definition of a Shiny web application.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nshinyUI(pageWithSidebar(\n  headerPanel(\"What is the risk that your child has RSV?\"),\n\nsidebarPanel(\n  checkboxInput(\"month\", label = \"Born between April 1 and September 30\", value = FALSE),\n  checkboxInput(\"weight\", label = \"Birthweight >= 8.18 pounds (4.5 kg)\", value = FALSE),\n  checkboxInput(\"sibs\", label = \"Has siblings (<= age 18) living in the home or has gone to day care in the past year\", value = FALSE),\n  checkboxInput(\"education\", label = \"At least one parent has earned a Bachelor's degree or higher\", value = FALSE)\n),\n```\n\nSlide With UI Code (cont.)\n========================================================\n\n```{r}\nmainPanel(\n  p('In a 2011 article in the journal Pediatrics (127:1, 35-41) Houben et al. published a scoring system to determine \n    a child’s risk for hospitalized respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), a \n    common infection in children seen in outpatient offices. You can determine a child’s risk for the disease by \n    answering these questions.
